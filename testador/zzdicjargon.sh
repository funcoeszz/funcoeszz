drum: n.
Ancient techspeak term referring to slow, cylindrical magnetic
media that were once state-of-the-art storage devices. Under
some versions of BSD Unix the disk partition used for swapping
is still called /dev/drum; this has led to considerable humor
and not a few straight-faced but utterly bogus ‘explanations’
getting foisted on newbies. See also “ The Story of Mel'” in
Appendix A.
